v1.0.4 (2023-02-13)
-------------------

- Only show the warning about an unsupported configuration once. (#22)

!!! **WARNING** !!!

InactivePanes has been deprecated and is no longer needed because its
functionality has been integrated into Sublime Text 4 natively (released on
2021-05-20), making this giant hack redundant.

The default themes support this natively and the behavior can be disabled with
the `inactive_sheet_dimming` setting. If you are using a third-party theme that
does not support this already, refer to the details in the following issue
comment:

https://github.com/sublimehq/sublime_text/issues/2041#issuecomment-765531886

You can manually add this to the theme you are using following these instructions:

1. Open the Command Palette.
2. Select *UI: Customize Theme*.
3. On the right panel, add the following entries to the `rules` array:

```json
        {
           "class": "sheet_contents",
           "background_modifier": "",
        },
        {
            "class": "sheet_contents",
            "settings": {"inactive_sheet_dimming": true},
            "attributes": ["file_dark", "!highlighted"],
            "background_modifier": "blend(white 98%)",
        },
        {
           "class": "sheet_contents",
           "settings": {"inactive_sheet_dimming": true},
           "attributes": ["file_light", "!highlighted"],
           "background_modifier": "blend(black 90%)",
        },
```

You may adjust the `background_modifier` as needed (also for the default themes)
using a color modifier as documented below.
