v1.0.0 (2014-08-12)
-------------------

- Remove the old workaround that involved saving generated files to a different
  package ("InactivePanes_") (#7)
- ST2: Fix new and unnamed tabs not being dimmed at all
- ST2: Attempt to fix crashes when dragging tabs in multi-group layouts
- Settings are now taken from project and syntax-specific settings as well.
  With this you can adjust each color scheme's dim strength and color
  exactly where you define the scheme, for example to match your theme.
