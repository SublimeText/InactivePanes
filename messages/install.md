Congratulations, you have successfully installed InactivePanes. However,
InactivePanes has been deprecated in favor of the native dimming feature of
Sublime Text 4.0.

Please see the project README below for detailed instructions to enable this
feature if you are using a third-party theme that does not support it.

https://github.com/SublimeText/InactivePanes#readme

Following is the original installation message.

---

When you want to disable this package, use Package Control's *Disable Package*
and *Enable Package* commands. Alternatively you can adjust your
`"ignored_packages"` setting manually.

**Warning**: If you want to remove the package, use Package Control's *Remove
Package* command. Do **not** delete the plugin folder by yourself if you didn't
disable the package before and ST is not running! This will cause various error
messages because of outdated file references (but nothing critical).

You can read the readme (with all available settings) online at:
